Problem

To allow for the presence of its varying forms, a protein motif is represented by a shorthand as follows: [XY] means "either X or Y" and {X} means "any amino acid except X." For example, the N-glycosylation motif is written as N{P}[ST]{P}.

You can see the complete description and features of a particular protein by its access ID "uniprot_id" in the UniProt database, by following this link. Alternatively, you can obtain a protein sequence in FASTA format by following this link. For example, the data for protein B5ZC00 can be found at http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/B5ZC00.

Given: At most 15 UniProt Protein Database access IDs.

Return: For each protein possessing the N-glycosylation motif, output its given access ID followed by a list of locations in the protein string where the motif can be found.
